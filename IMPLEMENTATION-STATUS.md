# WRM Timeline Enhancement - Phase 1 Implementation Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status: Database Schema Enhanced âœ…

We've successfully enhanced the Prisma schema with:
- âœ… Time-aware ticket states (FUTURE, ACTIVE, PAST_UNTOUCHED, PAST_CONFIRMED)
- âœ… Enhanced TicketType model with custom properties support
- âœ… AI assistant integration foundations
- âœ… Performance indexes and migration scripts

## ðŸš€ Next: Execute Migration and Start Implementation

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# Make migration script executable
chmod +x migrate-timeline-phase1.sh

# Execute the migration
./migrate-timeline-phase1.sh
```

### 2. Update Shared Types (Critical First Step)
The shared types package needs immediate updates to reflect the new schema.

### 3. Update Backend Services
Extend existing ticket services to use the new TicketStatus enum.

### 4. Begin Frontend Timeline Components
Start building the core TimelineGrid component with drag-and-drop.
