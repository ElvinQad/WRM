# WRM Architecture Documentation

This directory contains the modular architecture documentation for the WRM (Work Resource Management) Timeline project, organized by functional area and implementation phase.

## 📁 Architecture Document Structure

### Overview Documents
- [`system-overview.md`](./system-overview.md) - High-level system architecture and tech stack
- [`data-architecture.md`](./data-architecture.md) - Database design, type system, and data flow
- [`api-architecture.md`](./api-architecture.md) - Backend API design and integration patterns

### Feature-Specific Architecture
- [`epic-1-timeline-architecture.md`](./epic-1-timeline-architecture.md) - ✅ **COMPLETE** Dynamic timeline implementation
- [`epic-2-custom-properties-architecture.md`](./epic-2-custom-properties-architecture.md) - 🚧 **IN PROGRESS** Custom ticket types
- [`epic-3-ai-architecture.md`](./epic-3-ai-architecture.md) - 📋 **PLANNED** AI assistant integration
- [`epic-4-social-architecture.md`](./epic-4-social-architecture.md) - 📋 **PLANNED** Social collaboration features

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- [`testing-architecture.md`](./testing-architecture.md) - Comprehensive testing strategy and infrastructure
- [`performance-architecture.md`](./performance-architecture.md) - Performance requirements and optimization strategies
- [`security-architecture.md`](./security-architecture.md) - Security design and implementation patterns

### Implementation Guides
- [`development-workflow.md`](./development-workflow.md) - Development setup, workflows, and best practices
- [`deployment-architecture.md`](./deployment-architecture.md) - Deployment strategy and infrastructure requirements

## 🎯 Current Status

| Epic | Status | Architecture Document | Implementation |
|------|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Epic 1: Dynamic Timeline** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | [Timeline Architecture](./epic-1-timeline-architecture.md) | 100% - Drag-drop, multi-view, real-time |
| **Epic 2: Custom Properties** | 🚧 **IN PROGRESS** | [Custom Properties Architecture](./epic-2-custom-properties-architecture.md) | 20% - Redux foundation laid |
| **Epic 3: AI Assistant** | 📋 **PLANNED** | [AI Architecture](./epic-3-ai-architecture.md) | 0% - Design phase |
| **Epic 4: Social Features** | 📋 **PLANNED** | [Social Architecture](./epic-4-social-architecture.md) | 0% - Requirements gathering |

## 🔄 Migration from Brownfield Document

This modular structure replaces the comprehensive `brownfield-architecture.md` to provide:

1. **Focused Documentation**: Each document covers a specific architectural area
2. **Implementation-Aligned**: Documents match development phases and epic completion
3. **Maintainable Structure**: Easier to update individual areas without affecting others
4. **Team Collaboration**: Different teams can work on different architectural areas

## 📋 How to Use This Documentation

### For Developers
1. **Start with System Overview** for general understanding
2. **Review Epic-Specific Documents** for feature implementation
3. **Consult Cross-Cutting Concerns** for shared patterns
4. **Follow Implementation Guides** for development workflow

### For Architects
1. **System Overview & Data Architecture** for foundational design
2. **Epic-Specific Architecture** for feature planning
3. **Performance & Security Architecture** for non-functional requirements
4. **Deployment Architecture** for infrastructure planning

### For Project Managers
1. **Epic Status Overview** (above table) for current state
2. **Implementation Guides** for timeline and resource planning
3. **Testing Architecture** for quality assurance planning

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Complete Epic 2 Architecture** - Finalize custom properties design
2. **Begin Epic 3 Design Phase** - AI assistant architecture planning
3. **Performance Optimization** - Epic 1 performance review and enhancement
4. **Infrastructure Planning** - Production deployment architecture
