# Security Integration

## Current Security Implementation

**✅ Existing Security Measures:**
- JWT-based authentication implemented
- Password hashing with proper security
- API endpoint protection with guards
- CORS configuration for frontend integration

**✅ Database Security:**
- Prisma ORM prevents SQL injection
- User data isolation per account
- Proper relationship constraints

## Enhancement-Specific Security Requirements

**1. Timeline Security (Epic 1):**
- Drag-and-drop operations must validate user ownership
- Real-time updates must verify user permissions
- Timeline data must be properly isolated per user

**2. Custom Properties Security (Epic 2):**
- JSON custom properties need input validation
- XSS prevention for user-defined property values
- Schema validation for custom field definitions

**3. AI Assistant Security (Epic 3):**
- AI service communications need encryption
- User data sent to AI services needs anonymization options
- AI-generated content needs validation before storage

## Security Testing Requirements (Per PRD)

**OWASP Top 10 Compliance:**
- Input validation for all timeline operations
- Authentication bypass testing for timeline APIs
- Injection testing for custom property fields
- Authorization testing for cross-user data access

**Performance Security:**
- Rate limiting for drag-and-drop operations (prevent abuse)
- Timeline data caching security (no data leakage)
- AI service rate limiting and abuse prevention
