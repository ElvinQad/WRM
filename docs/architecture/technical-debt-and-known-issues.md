# Technical Debt and Known Issues

## Current Technical Debt Analysis

**‚úÖ Well-Architected Areas:**
- Clean monorepo structure with proper workspace configuration
- Type-safe API contracts with shared types package
- Modern tech stack with good development experience
- Proper separation of concerns between frontend/backend

**üü° Areas Requiring Attention for Timeline Enhancement:**
1. **Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket infrastructure exists yet
2. **Complex State Management**: Timeline drag-and-drop will require sophisticated state coordination
3. **Performance Optimization**: No caching strategy for timeline data
4. **Error Handling**: Need robust conflict resolution for concurrent timeline edits

**‚ùå Missing Infrastructure for Enhancement:**
1. **WebSocket Connection**: Required for real-time timeline updates
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Frontend needs to handle optimistic state changes
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Timeline conflicts need resolution strategy
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Timeline rendering performance needs tracking

## Critical Implementation Constraints

**Database Performance:**
- Timeline queries will require proper indexing on `startTime`, `endTime`, `userId`
- Custom properties JSON queries need optimization strategy
- Concurrent ticket updates need proper locking mechanism

**Frontend Performance:**
- Timeline with 500+ tickets needs virtualization
- Drag-and-drop operations need smooth 60fps performance
- Real-time updates need efficient Redux state updates

**Browser Compatibility (Per PRD):**
- Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- Drag-and-drop API needs consistent cross-browser behavior
- Voice input integration requires Web Speech API compatibility
