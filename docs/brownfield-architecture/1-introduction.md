# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing the "Timeline" project with an AI-powered life dashboard. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of new features while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

This document supplements the existing project architecture by defining how new components will integrate with current systems. Where conflicts arise between new and existing patterns, this document provides guidance on maintaining consistency while implementing enhancements.

## 1.1. Existing Project Analysis

My analysis of your project confirms the following:

*   **Primary Purpose**: A full-stack application for managing a personal timeline.
*   **Current Tech Stack**:
    *   **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Backend**: NestJS, TypeScript, Supabase (for Auth).
    *   **Shared**: A dedicated `@wrm/types` package for type safety.
*   **Architecture Style**: Monorepo with a package-based structure (frontend, backend, types). The frontend uses the Next.js App Router, and the backend is modular.
*   **Deployment Method**: The deno.json file contains build scripts for each package, suggesting a multi-step build process.
