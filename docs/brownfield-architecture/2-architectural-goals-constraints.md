# 2. Architectural Goals & Constraints

## Goals

*   **Scalability**: The system must support a growing number of users and collaborative features.
*   **Modularity**: Decouple features (Timeline, Tickets, AI Assistant) to allow for independent development and deployment.
*   **Real-time Interaction**: Support real-time updates for features like ticket manipulation and future collaborative editing.
*   **AI Integration**: Seamlessly integrate the AI Personal Assistant into the user workflow.

## Constraints

*   Must use the existing NestJS backend and Next.js frontend.
*   Authentication must continue to be handled by Supabase Auth.
*   The architecture must support the epics defined in the PRD.
