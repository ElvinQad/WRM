Status: RESOLVED on 2025-08-10

Summary
- Root cause: Prisma Client types were out of sync with the actual schema (Deno struggled to load CJS during generate), so fields like emailVerified, emailVerificationToken, passwordResetToken, passwordResetExpires, isInPool, and poolOrder werenâ€™t present in the generated TypeScript types.
- Fix applied:
    - Updated Prisma generator output to default (removed custom output path) in packages/backend/prisma/schema.prisma.
    - Ensured Prisma tasks run with CJS detection in Deno by adding --unstable-detect-cjs to prisma:* tasks in packages/backend/deno.json.
    - Regenerated Prisma Client and re-ran type checking and linting.

Verification
- Type check: PASS (deno task type-check)
- Lint: PASS (deno task lint)

Notes on code dispersion
- Kept a single source of truth for DB fields in Prisma schema; after generation, all services consume the same typed client.
- Reduced friction by centralizing Prisma CLI flags in tasks (no per-command workarounds needed).

Next minor cleanups (optional)
- Consider extracting the ticket-to-DTO mapping in TicketsService into a small util for reuse if needed elsewhere.
