*This epic covers the core interface for viewing and navigating the user's schedule.*

*   **User Story 1.1 (View Switching):** âœ… **COMPLETE**
    *   **As a user,** I want to select 'Hourly', 'Daily', 'Weekly', or 'Monthly' from a dropdown menu.
    *   **So that** I can view my timeline at my preferred level of detail.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A dropdown menu is present in the main UI.
        *   Selecting an option from the dropdown immediately re-renders the timeline view to the corresponding scale.
        *   The timeline grid and ticket displays adjust logically for each view.

*   **User Story 1.2 (Date Navigation):** âœ… **COMPLETE**
    *   **As a user,** I want to use a slider with two handles to select a start and end date.
    *   **So that** I can quickly navigate to any period in my timeline.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The slider updates the timeline view in real-time as it's adjusted.
        *   The current date range selected by the slider is clearly displayed.
        *   The timeline view zooms in or out to fit the selected date range.

*   **User Story 1.3 (Ticket Manipulation):** âœ… **COMPLETE**
    *   **As a user,** I want to drag and drop a ticket to a new time slot.
    *   **So that** I can easily reschedule my activities.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Clicking and holding a ticket "lifts" it from the timeline with visual elevation effect.
        *   Dropping the ticket in a new valid time slot updates its scheduled time.
        *   The ticket's data (start and end time) is updated in the backend.
        *   **Local Testing:** CLI command `./packages/testing/test-timeline-drag-drop.sh` verifies drag-drop functionality.
        *   **Validation:** Invalid drop zones (overlapping tickets, past dates) show error feedback.
        *   **Performance:** Drag operation responds within 50ms, backend update within 500ms.

*   **User Story 1.4 (Ticket Resizing):** âœ… **COMPLETE**
    *   **As a user,** I want to click and drag the edge of a ticket.
    *   **So that** I can change its duration.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Hovering over the start or end edge of a ticket changes the cursor to a resize icon.
        *   Dragging the edge modifies the ticket's start or end time with real-time preview.
        *   The ticket's duration is updated in the backend.
        *   **Local Testing:** CLI command `./packages/testing/test-timeline-drag-drop.sh` validates resize functionality.

*   **User Story 2.2 (Custom Property Definition):**
    *   **As a user,** when I create or edit a ticket type, I want to add custom properties to it.
    *   **So that** I can capture all the relevant information for that type of activity.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   In the "Ticket Settings" for a specific type, there is an "Add Property" button.
        *   The user can define a property name and select a property field type (e.g., Text, Number, Checkbox, Date, Dropdown).
        *   These defined properties will appear as fields on all tickets of that type.
        *   **Local Testing:** CLI command `deno test packages/testing/backend/custom-properties.test.ts` validates property schemas.
        *   **Validation:** Property names unique per ticket type, support 5 field types minimum.
        *   **Data Integrity:** Existing tickets of the type automatically gain new properties with default values.

*   **User Story 2.3 (Time-Aware State Visualization):**

    *   **As a user,** I want to create child tickets under parent tickets to break down complex tasks.
    *   **So that** I can organize related sub-tasks and track progress hierarchically.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Tickets have an "Add Child Ticket" option that creates a sub-ticket.
        *   Parent tickets visually indicate the number of child tickets (e.g., badge, expand/collapse).
        *   Child tickets inherit some properties from parent but can be customized independently.
        *   Parent ticket completion status reflects child ticket progress (optional auto-complete when all children done).

## **7. Next Steps**
*   **Current Status:** Epic 1 (Dynamic Timeline) is âœ… **COMPLETE** with full drag-and-drop, resizing, and view management.
*   **Next Priority:** Epic 2 (Custom Ticket Types) implementation using NestJS + Fastify + Prisma backend stack.
*   **Future Roadmap:** Epic 3 (AI Assistant) and Epic 4 (Social & Collaboration) for full MVP completion.
*   **Architect Prompt:** "Please review this completed PRD and the existing codebase. Create a detailed brownfield architecture document that outlines the necessary changes to the NestJS + Fastify + Prisma backend and Next.js frontend to implement Epic 2, 3 & 4 features."
*   **Implementation Focus:** Custom ticket types with Prisma schema extensions, AI integration architecture, and social sharing mechanisms.
*   **UX Expert Prompt:** "Please review the UI/UX goals in this PRD. Create wireframes for the Settings page, Ticket Type creation interface, AI Assistant chat interface, and Social/Collaboration views."
