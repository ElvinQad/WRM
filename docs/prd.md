## **1. Goals and Background Context (UPDATED)**

#### **Goals**

*   Create the first true Intelligence Amplification System that transforms passive knowledge into active intelligence
*   Enable humans to capture, apply, and compound their learning through AI-native workflows
*   Provide intelligent focus enforcement and execution support for deep work
*   Automate coordination overhead through agent-to-agent protocols
*   Build a living, breathing second brain that actually helps users think and act better
*   Bridge the knowledge graveyard problem by making information actively applicable
*   Create seamless transitions from knowledge capture → planning → focused execution → learning

#### **Background Context**

Knowledge workers face three interconnected crises that current tools fail to solve holistically:

1. **The Planning-Execution Gap**: Traditional task managers help plan but don't ensure execution. People know WHAT to do but struggle with HOW and WHEN.

2. **The Knowledge Graveyard Problem**: Professionals accumulate vast amounts of information (articles, notes, learnings) that never gets applied. Knowledge management tools like Obsidian become write-only databases where valuable insights go to die.

3. **The Coordination Overhead**: Scheduling, task distribution, and team coordination consume 20-30% of productive time, yet no tool automates this intelligently.

**The Meta Problem**: These aren't separate issues - they're symptoms of working with tools that don't understand context, can't learn from patterns, and treat information as passive rather than active.

This project aims to create the first true Intelligence Amplification System that transforms passive knowledge into active intelligence, enabling humans to capture, apply, and compound their learning while seamlessly coordinating with others through AI-native protocols.

## **Epic 1: The Dynamic Timeline** ✅ **COMPLETED**
*This epic covers the core interface for viewing and navigating the user's schedule.*

*   **User Story 1.1 (View Switching):** ✅ **COMPLETE**
    *   **As a user,** I want to select 'Hourly', 'Daily', 'Weekly', or 'Monthly' from a dropdown menu.
    *   **So that** I can view my timeline at my preferred level of detail.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A dropdown menu is present in the main UI.
        *   Selecting an option from the dropdown immediately re-renders the timeline view to the corresponding scale.
        *   The timeline grid and ticket displays adjust logically for each view.

*   **User Story 1.2 (Date Navigation):** ✅ **COMPLETE**
    *   **As a user,** I want to use a slider with two handles to select a start and end date.
    *   **So that** I can quickly navigate to any period in my timeline.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The slider updates the timeline view in real-time as it's adjusted.
        *   The current date range selected by the slider is clearly displayed.
        *   The timeline view zooms in or out to fit the selected date range.

*   **User Story 1.3 (Ticket Manipulation):** ✅ **COMPLETE**
    *   **As a user,** I want to drag and drop a ticket to a new time slot.
    *   **So that** I can easily reschedule my activities.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Clicking and holding a ticket "lifts" it from the timeline with visual elevation effect.
        *   Dropping the ticket in a new valid time slot updates its scheduled time.
        *   The ticket's data (start and end time) is updated in the backend.
        *   **Local Testing:** CLI command `./packages/testing/test-timeline-drag-drop.sh` verifies drag-drop functionality.
        *   **Validation:** Invalid drop zones (overlapping tickets, past dates) show error feedback.
        *   **Performance:** Drag operation responds within 50ms, backend update within 500ms.

*   **User Story 1.4 (Ticket Resizing):** ✅ **COMPLETE**
    *   **As a user,** I want to click and drag the edge of a ticket.
    *   **So that** I can change its duration.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Hovering over the start or end edge of a ticket changes the cursor to a resize icon.
        *   Dragging the edge modifies the ticket's start or end time with real-time preview.
        *   The ticket's duration is updated in the backend.
        *   **Local Testing:** CLI command `./packages/testing/test-timeline-drag-drop.sh` validates resize functionality.
        *   **Validation:** Minimum duration enforced (5 minutes in implementation), conflicts prevented.
        *   **Performance:** Resize preview updates within 50ms, backend save within 500ms.

## **Epic 2: Intelligent & Customizable Tickets with Focus Modes** 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**
*This epic covers the creation, customization, and state management of tickets.*

*   **User Story 2.1 (Ticket Type Creation):**
    *   **As a user,** I want to navigate to a 'Ticket Settings' page and create a new ticket type with a unique name.

    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   There is a dedicated "Settings" area in the application.
        *   Within Settings, there is an option to "Create New Ticket Type."
        *   The user can enter a name for the new type and save it.
        *   The system prevents the creation of duplicate ticket type names with clear error messaging.
        *   **Local Testing:** CLI command `deno test packages/testing/backend/ticket-types.test.ts` validates CRUD operations.
        *   **Validation:** Ticket type names must be 3-50 characters, alphanumeric plus spaces.
        *   **Performance:** Type creation saves within 300ms, updates UI immediately.

*   **User Story 2.2 (Custom Property Definition):**
    *   **As a user,** when I create or edit a ticket type, I want to add custom properties to it.
    *   **So that** I can capture all the relevant information for that type of activity.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   In the "Ticket Settings" for a specific type, there is an "Add Property" button.
        *   The user can define a property name and select a property field type (e.g., Text, Number, Checkbox, Date, Dropdown).
        *   These defined properties will appear as fields on all tickets of that type.
        *   **Local Testing:** CLI command `deno test packages/testing/backend/custom-properties.test.ts` validates property schemas.
        *   **Validation:** Property names unique per ticket type, support 5 field types minimum.
        *   **Data Integrity:** Existing tickets of the type automatically gain new properties with default values.

*   **User Story 2.3 (Time-Aware State Visualization):**
    *   **As a user,** I want to instantly see the status of my tickets based on their border color.

        *   A ticket whose time has passed but *was interacted with* has a distinct "Confirmed" border color (e.g., amber).

*   **User Story 2.4 (Repeatable Tickets):**
    *   **As a user,** I want to mark tickets as repeatable with customizable recurrence patterns.
    *   **So that** I can automatically schedule recurring activities without manual duplication.

        *   Tickets have a "Repeat" toggle option in their settings.
        *   Users can configure repeat patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, custom intervals).
        *   The system automatically creates future instances based on the pattern.
        *   Users can modify individual instances without affecting the entire series.
        *   **Local Testing:** CLI command `deno test packages/testing/backend/recurring-tickets.test.ts` validates recurrence logic.

        *   **Performance:** Batch creation of recurring instances completes within 1 second for 100 occurrences.

*   **User Story 2.5 (Child Tickets & Hierarchical Structure):**
    *   **As a user,** I want to create child tickets under parent tickets to break down complex tasks.
    *   **So that** I can organize related sub-tasks and track progress hierarchically.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Tickets have an "Add Child Ticket" option that creates a sub-ticket.
        *   Parent tickets visually indicate the number of child tickets (e.g., badge, expand/collapse).
        *   Child tickets inherit some properties from parent but can be customized independently.
        *   Parent ticket completion status reflects child ticket progress (optional auto-complete when all children done).
        *   **Local Testing:** CLI command `deno test packages/testing/backend/ticket-hierarchy.test.ts` validates parent-child relationships.
