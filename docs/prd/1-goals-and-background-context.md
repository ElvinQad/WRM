# **1. Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

*   Empower individuals to manage their time with a hyper-personalized timeline tool.
*   Provide intelligent assistance via a personal AI agent to reduce manual planning.
*   Create a seamless transition from personal management to social collaboration.
*   Build a dynamic, timeline-based application for managing activities with customizable "tickets."

### **Background Context**

Individuals currently lack a deeply personal and intelligent tool to track their daily activities and goals. Existing solutions are often rigid, demand constant manual input, and fail to proactively assist the user. This project aims to solve that by creating a flexible, AI-powered life dashboard that serves as a foundation for both personal organization and future social collaboration.
