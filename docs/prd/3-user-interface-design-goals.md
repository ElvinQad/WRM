# **3. User Interface Design Goals**

*   **Overall UX Vision:** A clean, intuitive, and highly visual interface that makes schedule management feel effortless and fluid. The UI should feel like a personal dashboard, not a rigid calendar.
*   **Key Interaction Paradigms:** Direct manipulation (drag-and-drop, resize), conversational UI (chat/voice with AI), and clear visual state indicators (color-coded borders).
*   **Core Screens and Views:**
    1.  **Timeline View:** The main dashboard displaying tickets on a dynamic grid.
    2.  **Ticket Detail Modal:** A popup for viewing and editing a ticket's custom properties.
    3.  **Settings Page:** A dedicated area for managing ticket types and configuring the AI assistant.
    4.  **Friends & Sharing Page:** Interface for managing collaborators and shared content.
    5.  **Project Management View:** Dedicated interface for creating and managing shared projects.
    6.  **Notifications Center:** Real-time updates for shared content, assignments, and AI suggestions.
*   **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliance with keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color contrast ratios
*   **Performance Expectations:** 
    *   Timeline view renders within 300ms for up to 100 tickets
    *   Drag-and-drop operations provide visual feedback within 50ms
    *   Real-time updates propagate to UI within 500ms
    *   Voice command processing responds within 2 seconds
*   **Error Handling & Recovery:**
    *   Failed drag-and-drop operations revert ticket to original position with user notification
    *   Network connectivity issues display offline mode with local caching
    *   AI assistant failures gracefully degrade to manual input mode
    *   Data conflicts during real-time updates show merge resolution UI
*   **User Feedback Mechanisms:**
    *   Toast notifications for successful operations (ticket saved, moved, etc.)
    *   Progress indicators for AI processing and data synchronization
    *   Contextual help tooltips for complex UI interactions
    *   In-app feedback collection for AI assistant suggestions
*   **Branding:** Modern, clean, and professional with a user-selectable light/dark mode.
*   **Target Device and Platforms:** Web Responsive
