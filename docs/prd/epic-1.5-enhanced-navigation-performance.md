# **Epic 1.5: Enhanced Navigation & Performance** âœ… **COMPLETED**
*This epic enhances the timeline interface with heat map navigation, selective loading, and improved scrolling behavior.*

*   **User Story 1.5.1 (Heat Map Navigation):**
    *   **As a user,** I want to see a heat map showing my activity completion status across dates.
    *   **So that** I can quickly identify productive periods and navigate to specific dates.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Heat map displays completion status using color intensity/coding.
        *   Clicking any date in the heat map navigates to that period.
        *   Selected date ranges are visually highlighted.
        *   Heat map updates in real-time as tickets are completed/modified.
        *   **Performance:** Heat map renders within 300ms, updates within 100ms.

*   **User Story 1.5.2 (Selective Data Loading):**
    *   **As a user,** I want the timeline to load only relevant dates for better performance.
    *   **So that** I can navigate quickly without waiting for unnecessary data.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Daily mode loads 3-day window (yesterday, today, tomorrow).
        *   Weekly mode loads 2-week window (current week + next week).
        *   Hourly mode loads current day + 6 hours before/after.
        *   Background loading prefetches adjacent periods.
        *   **Performance:** Initial load under 1 second, navigation under 200ms.

*   **User Story 1.5.3 (Timeline Scrolling Enhancement):**
    *   **As a user,** I want to scroll the timeline horizontally using mouse wheel and touch.
    *   **So that** I can navigate through time periods naturally without dragging.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Mouse wheel over timeline scrolls horizontally through time.
        *   Touch devices support horizontal swipe scrolling.
        *   Scroll behavior respects selective loading boundaries.
        *   Smooth scrolling animation with momentum on touch devices.
        *   **Performance:** Scroll response within 16ms for 60fps smoothness.
