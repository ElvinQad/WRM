### **Project Brief: Timeline**

* **Project Title:** Timeline: The AI-Powered Life Dashboard
* **Author/Owner:** You
* **Date:** July 21, 2025
* **Version:** 2.0

#### **1. The Problem**
Individuals lack a deeply personal and intelligent tool to track their daily activities and goals. Existing solutions are rigid, require constant manual input, and fail to proactively assist the user. Furthermore, there's no seamless way to transition from personal planning to social collaboration.

#### **2. Vision & Mission**
* **Vision:** To create a hyper-personalized timeline tool that empowers individuals to manage their time with complete freedom, intelligently assisted by a personal AI agent, and seamlessly connected for effortless collaboration.
* **Mission:** We will build a dynamic, timeline-based application where users can manage their activities using customizable "tickets." A core AI Personal Assistant will help users create, manage, and interact with their timeline and other users. This personal dashboard will serve as the foundation for a collaborative social network.

#### **3. Target Audience**
* **Primary (V1):** Individuals seeking a flexible and intelligent way to track their life/work (e.g., students, freelancers, professionals, life-loggers).
* **Secondary (Post-V1):** Small teams, friends, and collaborators who want to share and work on tasks together.

#### **4. Core Features & Epics**

* **Epic 1: The Dynamic Timeline**
    * Interactive timeline interface with  daily, weekly.
    * Navigation via a resizable date-range slider.
    * Direct manipulation of tickets on the timeline (drag to move, resize).

* **Epic 2: Intelligent & Customizable Tickets**
    * A "Ticket Settings" area for creating user-defined ticket types with custom properties.
    * Time-aware ticket states distinguished by border colors (Future, Active, Past-Untouched, Past-Confirmed).

* **Epic 3: The AI Personal Assistant**
    * **Creation:** Accepts voice and chat commands to create tickets; can proactively suggest and negotiate the creation of single or multiple tickets based on user goals.
    * **Reminders:** Provides both reactive (due-time) and proactive (context-aware) reminders, including daily/weekly briefings.
    * **Interaction:** Can interact with other users/agents on behalf of the user to negotiate scheduling.
    * **Configuration:** The agent's autonomy and communication tone are configurable by the user.

* **Epic 4: Social & Collaboration**
    * Users can share their entire timeline, a single ticket, or a "Project" (collection of tickets).
    * Friends can view and interact with shared items.
    * Users can assign tickets to others, which appear "greyed out" until accepted.

#### **5. Success Metrics**
* High user engagement and daily active users.
* Number of custom ticket types created.
* **High adoption and usage of AI Assistant features.**
* Volume of items shared between users.

#### **6. Out of Scope (For the first version)**
* Advanced team management features (permissions, roles).
* Real-time, simultaneous editing of a single ticket.
