# Story 1.5.3: Timeline Scrolling Enhancement

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to scroll the timeline horizontally using mouse wheel and touch,
**so that** I can navigate through time periods naturally without dragging.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Mouse wheel over timeline scrolls horizontally through time.
2. Touch devices support horizontal swipe scrolling.
3. Scroll behavior respects selective loading boundaries.
4. Smooth scrolling animation with momentum on touch devices.
5. **Performance:** Scroll response within 16ms for 60fps smoothness.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 5)**: Implement mouse wheel horizontal scrolling for timeline
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Add mouse wheel event listeners to Timeline component in `packages/frontend/src/components/timeline/components/Timeline.tsx`
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Convert vertical wheel delta to horizontal scroll movement
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Integrate with existing `useTimelinePanning.ts` hook for scroll logic
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Add performance optimization to ensure 16ms response time (60fps)
  - [x] Subtask 1.5: Add unit tests for mouse wheel scroll calculations

- [x] **Task 2 (AC: 2, 4)**: Implement touch device horizontal swipe scrolling
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Add touch event listeners (touchstart, touchmove, touchend) to Timeline component
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Implement touch gesture detection for horizontal swipes
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Add momentum scrolling animation for natural touch behavior
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Integrate touch scrolling with existing timeline navigation system
  - [x] Subtask 2.5: Add unit tests for touch gesture calculations

- [x] **Task 3 (AC: 3)**: Integrate scrolling with selective loading boundaries
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Connect scrolling logic with selective data loading from Story 1.5.2
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Add boundary detection to trigger data loading when approaching edges
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Implement smooth scrolling limits based on loaded data ranges
  - [x] Subtask 3.4: Add prefetching trigger when user scrolls near boundaries

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5.1 (Heat Map Navigation): The timeline already has sophisticated navigation through `useTimelinePanning.ts` and Redux state management. The heat map navigation provides date selection functionality that should be preserved during scrolling.

From Story 1.5.2 (Selective Data Loading): The selective loading system provides data boundaries that scrolling must respect. Background prefetching mechanism is available for adjacent periods when scrolling approaches boundaries.

### Data Models
**Timeline State Management:** [Source: architecture/component-architecture-integration.md#redux-state-management]
```typescript
interface TimelineState {
  currentView: 'daily' | 'weekly' ;
  currentDate: Date;
  dateRange: { start: Date; end: Date };
  scrollPosition: number;
  // Existing from previous stories
}
```

**Scroll Event Handling:** No specific guidance found in architecture docs for scroll event handling patterns.

### API Specifications
**Timeline Navigation Integration:** [Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md#timeline-apis]
- Must work with existing timeline API endpoint structure
- Scrolling should trigger selective data loading when approaching boundaries
- Must maintain JWT authentication for any API calls
- Performance requirement: Scroll response within 16ms for 60fps

### Component Specifications
**Timeline Component Integration:** [Source: architecture/component-architecture-integration.md#component-architecture]
```typescript
Timeline (Main Orchestrator)
├── TimelineHeader (View Controls & Navigation)  # Keep existing navigation
├── TimeMarkers (Time Grid & Current Time)       # Sync with scroll position
├── TicketComponent (Draggable Tickets)          # Maintain during scroll
├── HeatMapNavigator (From Story 1.5.1)          # Sync with scroll position
└── Enhanced scrolling integration
```

**Hooks Integration:** [Source: architecture/component-architecture-integration.md#hook-architecture]
```typescript
// Enhanced useTimelinePanning hook
useTimelinePanning (Navigation & Scrolling)
├── Mouse wheel horizontal scrolling
├── Touch gesture detection
├── Scroll boundary management
├── Integration with selective loading
└── Performance optimization (16ms response)
```

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Testing Standards:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy-integration.md#testing-requirements]
- Test file location: `packages/frontend/src/components/timeline/__tests__/`
- Use Deno test runner with Jest configuration
- Follow existing component testing patterns
- Performance testing for 60fps smoothness requirement

**Integration Testing:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy-integration.md#integration-testing]
- Cross-component scroll interaction testing
- Touch device simulation testing
- Selective loading boundary integration testing
- Redux state synchronization testing

**Performance Testing Requirements:**
- Scroll event handling performance (16ms target)
- Memory usage during extended scrolling sessions
- Frame rate monitoring during scroll animations
- Touch momentum animation performance testing

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Requirements:** [Source: architecture/component-architecture-integration.md#performance-optimization]
- Scroll response within 16ms for 60fps smoothness
- Must maintain existing 60fps timeline interactions
- Efficient event handling to prevent performance degradation
- Memory-optimized scroll position tracking

**Integration Constraints:**
- Must preserve existing heat map navigation functionality from Story 1.5.1
- Must work with selective loading boundaries from Story 1.5.2
- Must maintain existing drag-and-drop functionality
- Must preserve Redux state management patterns

### Security Considerations
No specific security requirements found in architecture docs for scrolling functionality.
