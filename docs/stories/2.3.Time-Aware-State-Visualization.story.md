# Story 2.3: Time-Aware State Visualization

## Status
Approve
## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to instantly see the status of my tickets based on their border color,
**so that** I can quickly assess my schedule and what needs attention.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Tickets scheduled in the future have a standard border color.
2. A ticket whose scheduled time is happening *now* has a distinct "Active" border color (e.g., green).
3. A ticket whose time has passed and has had *no interaction* has a distinct "Untouched" border color (e.g., red).
4. A ticket whose time has passed but *was interacted with* has a distinct "Confirmed" border color (e.g., amber).
5. **Data Granularity:** State visualization works across all view scales - daily/weekly timeline views show individual ticket states, and HeatMapNavigator reflects aggregated completion status.
6. **Interaction Definition:** "Interaction" means ONLY editing title, description, or custom properties. Moving/resizing tickets, clicking, viewing, or opening detail modal does NOT count as interaction.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1 (AC: 1-4)**: Implement ticket state calculation logic.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Create service methods to determine ticket state based on current time and interaction history.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Define state enum (Future, Active, Untouched, Confirmed) and corresponding color scheme.
- [ ] **Task 2 (AC: 1-4)**: Update `TicketComponent` with state-based styling.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Modify `TicketComponent` to apply border colors based on calculated state.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Ensure state colors are accessible and follow design system.
- [ ] **Task 3 (AC: 5)**: Integrate state visualization with HeatMapNavigator.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Enhance `HeatMapNavigator` activity calculation to include state-based completion indicators.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Update heat map color coding to reflect ticket completion vs. interaction status.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Ensure heat map indicators align with individual ticket state visualization.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story builds on the HeatMapNavigator from Epic 1.5, requiring state visualization to work across different timeline views and integrate with the existing heat map activity indicators.

### Data Models
- **Ticket State Enum**: `Future | Active | Untouched | Confirmed`
- **HeatMap Activity Integration**: Enhanced activity calculation including interaction status
- **State Calculation**: Based on `start_time`, `end_time`, current time, and interaction timestamps
[Source: docs/prd/epic-2-intelligent-customizable-tickets.md]

### API Specifications
- No new API endpoints required - uses existing ticket data with interaction tracking
- HeatMapNavigator uses existing activity calculation enhanced with state-based completion tracking
[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture/3-proposed-architecture.md]

### Component Specifications
- **`TicketComponent`**: Enhanced with state-based styling at `packages/frontend/src/components/timeline/components/TicketComponent.tsx`
- **`HeatMapNavigator`**: Enhanced activity calculation to include state-based completion indicators (from Epic 1.5)
- **State calculation logic**: New utility functions for determining ticket states
[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture/3-proposed-architecture.md#new-components]

### File Locations
- Ticket component: `packages/frontend/src/components/timeline/components/TicketComponent.tsx`
- State utilities: `packages/frontend/src/components/timeline/utils/ticketState.ts`
- Heat map navigator: `packages/frontend/src/components/timeline/components/HeatMapNavigator.tsx`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for state calculation logic with various time scenarios
- Visual regression tests for color schemes and accessibility
- Integration tests for HeatMapNavigator activity indicators
- Cross-browser compatibility tests for color rendering
[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture/2-architectural-goals-constraints.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing component architecture
- Color schemes must be accessible (WCAG compliance)
- State updates must be real-time as time progresses
- Performance impact minimal for large numbers of tickets
