# Story 2.4: Repeatable Tickets

## Status
In Progress - Core implementation complete, visual enhancements pending

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to mark tickets as repeatable with customizable recurrence patterns,
**so that** I can automatically schedule recurring activities without manual duplication.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Tickets have a "Repeat" toggle option in their settings.
2. Users can configure repeat patterns (daily, weekly, custom intervals).
3. The system automatically creates future instances based on the pattern.
4. Users can modify individual instances without affecting the entire series.
5. **Local Testing:** CLI command `deno test packages/testing/backend/recurring-tickets.test.ts` validates recurrence logic.
6. **Validation:** Recurrence patterns support end dates, occurrence limits, and skip dates.
7. **Performance:** Batch creation of recurring instances completes within 1 second for 100 occurrences.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on the Time-Aware State Visualization from Story 2.3, recurring tickets must preserve state calculation logic across all generated instances. The HeatMapNavigator integration should properly reflect recurring ticket patterns and their completion states.

### Recurrence Generation Strategy
**On-Demand Instance Generation**: Instead of pre-generating many future instances, the system uses a dynamic approach:
- Only the next upcoming instance is created when needed
- `generateNextInstance()` method creates the next occurrence based on the last generated instance
- This prevents database bloat and allows for pattern modifications without orphaned instances
- Visual indicators in the timeline/pool distinguish recurring tickets and instances
- Timeline queries will trigger next instance generation when current instances approach their start time

### Data Models
**New Prisma Schema Extensions:**
```prisma
model Ticket {
  // Existing fields...
  // NEW - Recurrence fields
  isRecurring      Boolean @default(false)
  recurrenceId     String? // Links instances to parent pattern
  parentTicketId   String? // For series relationship
  recurrenceRule   String? // RRULE format for complex patterns
  recurrenceEnd    DateTime? // End date for recurrence
  maxOccurrences   Int? // Limit total occurrences
  
  // Relationships
  parentTicket     Ticket? @relation("RecurringInstances", fields: [parentTicketId], references: [id])
  childInstances   Ticket[] @relation("RecurringInstances")
}

model RecurrencePattern {
  id          String @id @default(uuid())
  ticketId    String // Original ticket
  frequency   RecurrenceFrequency
  interval    Int @default(1) // Every N days/weeks/months
  skipDates   DateTime[] // Dates to skip
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  
  ticket Ticket @relation(fields: [ticketId], references: [id])
}

enum RecurrenceFrequency {
  DAILY
  WEEKLY  
  MONTHLY
  CUSTOM
}
```

### API Specifications
**New Endpoints:**
```typescript
// POST /api/tickets/recurrence/:id
interface CreateRecurrenceRequest {
  frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'custom';
  interval: number;
  endDate?: string;
  maxOccurrences?: number;
  skipDates?: string[];
}

// PUT /api/tickets/recurrence/:id
// Update recurrence pattern

// DELETE /api/tickets/recurrence/:id
// Remove recurrence from ticket

// POST /api/tickets/recurrence/:id/detach
// Detach instance from series for individual editing
```

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy-integration.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Must follow existing JWT authentication patterns from tickets module
- Use current Prisma service injection patterns for database operations
- Maintain existing error response format from tickets controller
- Performance requirement: batch creation under 1 second for 100 instances
- Database migrations must be non-breaking for existing ticket data

### Project Structure Alignment
All new files align with established module structure in `packages/backend/src/app/tickets/` for backend and `packages/frontend/src/components/tickets/` for frontend components. Testing follows the modular testing approach in `packages/testing/backend/`.

## Testing
**Test Standards from Architecture:**
- Use Deno test runner for backend unit tests
- Follow existing authentication middleware testing patterns
- Include performance benchmarks for batch operations
- Test recurrence pattern validation thoroughly
